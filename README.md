Ziosk challenge

Download the repository. It is a pretty simple .Net Core 3.0 CLI app since the instructions seem to want a minimum viable product. You can publish to any folder from within Visula Studio. Run the app from within the folder and it is pretty self explantory, enter a zip code to get a list of up to 5 restaurants within it. The app has minimal error handling and accepts whatever characters. If you enter "exit" it exits.
